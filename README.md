# EDA_IBM_attritiondata

Employee attrition is when employees leave the company. Towards Data Science (2018) “attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees over time”. This type of analysis considers retirement and resignation and looks for trends to retain the best employees and understand if there are variables affecting the retention in the organization.
The goal with this project is to predict employee attrition. We have used different predictive and correlation functions to understand and predict employee attrition, as well as determine key variables affecting attrition.
